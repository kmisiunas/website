## **How do you ensure an adequate replacement rate in systems that have no natural way to die?**

Schumpeter [claimed](http://web.uconn.edu/langlois/Creative%20destruction.htm) that the problem of capitalism is not how capital is allocated to *existing* structures but how structures are created and destroyed. Systems and institutions inevitably get stale or become less effective but also work very hard to survive. (See also: the [institutional imperative](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html).) Bankruptcy takes care of senescent businesses. But how do we get a sufficient replacement rate in systems and institutions that aren't naturally subject to extinction processes?



**How can we better understand the dynamics of progress in science?** 

We invest an enormous amount of time and money in science. Cumulative progress in science will probably do more than anything else to determine the shape of our collective future. In order to ensure that we're spending enough—and doing so on the right things and in the right ways (maybe we should have more independent institutes, or more funding of promising early-career scientists, or...)—how should we think about measuring the results?
