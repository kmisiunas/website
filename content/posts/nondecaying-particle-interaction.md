We have [discovered](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.038301) a particle-particle interactions  that have distance-independent strength. These are rare in physics, thus I am excited about this result. Learn more about the experiment from the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06048) or watch the video below
