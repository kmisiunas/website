Game of minesweeper with mathematical and logical elements set in a  theme and modes that resemble MineCraft for Android OS! The rules are like minesweeper, but with more adventure: multiple livesand hidden treasures to discover. The game also has virtually unlimited map size â€“ uncommon among minesweeper games. We hope you like it!
