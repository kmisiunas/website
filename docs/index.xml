      <description>Backtracking [1] Backtracking is a technique used to build up to a solution to a problem incrementally. These &amp;ldquo;partial solutions&amp;rdquo; can be phrased in terms of a sequence of decisions. Once it is determined that a &amp;ldquo;partial solution&amp;rdquo; is not viable (i.e. no subsequent decision can convert it into a solution) then the backtracking algorithm retraces its step to the last viable &amp;ldquo;partial solution&amp;rdquo; and tries again.
Visualizing the decisions as a tree, backtracking has many of the same properties of depth-first search.</description>

Heading 1 It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &amp;lsquo;Content here, content here&amp;rsquo;, making it look like readable English.</description>

      <title>QuipuNet: single-molecule analysis using deep-learning</title>

      <description>Abstract. Nanopore sensing is a versatile technique for the analysis of molecules on the single-molecule level. However, extracting information from data with established algorithms usually requires time-consuming checks by an experienced researcher due to inherent variability of solid-state nanopores. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the fully automated extraction of information from the time-series signals obtained by nanopore sensors. In our demonstration, we use a previously published data set on multiplexed single-molecule protein sensing.</description>
