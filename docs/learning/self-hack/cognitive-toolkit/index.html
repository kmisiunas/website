		<p>Our mind comes with strong biases that we inherit from our biology and society. My plan is to understand these biases and learn how to identify and counter them in my own life. I am slowly revising this list and adding references and examples. The numbering system is from the original list by Peter McIntyre [1].</p>
<h3 id="1-signallinghttplesswrongcomlwdidwhat_is_signaling_reallycountersignallinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikicountersignaling">(1) <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/did/what_is_signaling_really/">Signalling</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersignaling">countersignalling</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that an action conveys information to someone about the actor. Buying an expensive wedding ring conveys that you don’t think you’re about to run off immediately after the wedding (lest you lose three months of your salary). Countersignalling is when the information you’re trying to signal is so obvious that you need not have signalled in the first place. For instance, Warren Buffett doesn’t need to drive around in a Ferrari to signal how rich he is – everybody already knows that – and not driving around in a Ferrari differentiates him from the plebs that do need to drive one. Note: Buffett still lives in his house in Omaha that cost $31,000 back in 1958, despite being worth billions, but possibly for reasons other than countersignalling.</p>

<h3 id="2-nudgehttpsenwikipediaorgwikinudge_theory">(2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">Nudge</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The manner in which choices are presented to a target audience can have dramatic effects on their chosen action – even without changing the incentives which might typically motivate an individual to make a given choice. […] The tax office can write letters saying that 90% of people who work the same job as you have completed their tax return already. Your electricity company can install an electricity meter which constantly reminds you how many watts you’re chewing through at a given time. Male urinals are sometimes made with a small and shoddy picture of a housefly in the centre of them as a target to reduce puddles.</p>

<h3 id="3-marginal-thinkinghttpwwweconliborglibrarytopicscollegemarginshtml">(3) <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/margins.html">Marginal thinking</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What are extra resources worth? If you have no bananas, and you get a banana, it’s probably worth more to you than if you already had one million bananas and you get an extra. This is an important concept because it might lead to the realisation that not all the bananas hold the same value to you. Slightly less trivially, what matters with your charitable donation is what happens with that donation, not the average of what the charity achieves. Extra donations to distribute bed nets could do more once there are already the distribution lines established, so it could achieve more. Conversely, it might be already distributing at capacity, and extra donations buy bed nets for $10 instead of $5. […]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/2018/image02-300x263.png" alt="img">When we’re making decisions, we use two different systems. System 1 is fast and subconscious, often described as our ‘gut feeling’. It has an edge in social situations or when time is a limiting factor. System 2 is slower and more methodical, better with models and numbers, and deliberate.</p>

<h3 id="5-comparative-vs-absolute-advantagehttpwwweconliborglibrarytopicsdetailscomparativeadvantagehtml">(5) <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/comparativeadvantage.html">Comparative vs. absolute advantage</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are better than me at earning an income from your job and cleaning the house, you have an absolute advantage in both these activities. Does that mean that both of us are better off if you do both? Not necessarily. Suppose you earn $100/hour at work, 10 times more than my $10/hour and further that you clean the house approximately twice as fast as I do. Of these two jobs, I’m ‘least bad’ at cleaning the house, so it might be (depending on the social costs that this arrangement incurs) that both of us would be better off if you paid me $25 an hour to clean your house. Generally, people should do the action that they’re the least bad at, thus working to their comparative advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-efficient-market-hypothesishttpsenwikipediaorgwikiefficient-market_hypothesis">(6) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">Efficient market hypothesis</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many people approximately as clever as you who value approximately the same things you do. It’s unlikely you’ll be walking down the street and stumble on $100’000 sitting on the ground which no one else has picked up. In the same way, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to choose a company on the stock market that will do 100 times better than the average company which no one else has already found and invested in (driving the cost of parts of the company (shares) up). This is the same reason why you might have a hard time finding a car park that is (i) free, (ii) right next to work, and (iii) somewhere you can park in all day. Even though such car parks do exist, over time word gets out, and they are occupied in the short term or monetised in the long term. <a href="http://marketsineverything.com/">Everything is a market</a>. Thus, when taking the efficient market hypothesis into account, you should</p>
<ol>
<li>look for the things you value in places that other people have systematically failed to look, and</li>
<li>think that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="7-illusion-of-transparencyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiillusion_of_transparency">(7) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency">Illusion of transparency</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We tend to overestimate how much our mental state is known by others, a fact not helped by the ambiguity of the English language. “Elizabeth Newton created a simple test that she regarded as an illustration of the phenomenon. She would tap out a well-known song, such as “Happy Birthday” or the national anthem, with her finger and have the test subject guess the song. People usually estimate that the song will be guessed correctly in about 50 percent of the tests, but only 3 percent pick the correct song. The tapper can hear every note and the lyrics in his or her head; however, the observer, with no access to what the tapper is thinking, only hears a rhythmic tapping.” – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency">Wiki</a>. This phenomenon applies equally well to explanations of novel concepts and the interpretation of emotional states.</p>

<h3 id="8-opportunity-costhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiopportunity_cost">(8) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">Opportunity cost</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When we choose to take one option, we are implicitly not taking another. If you only have enough room for one meal and your favourite is the Pad Thai, you choose it. But this means you can’t also get the Massaman curry (your second favourite). Economists call this your opportunity cost — your choice minus the benefits of the next best alternative. Opportunity costs are everywhere and form a critical part of decision making. If you’re not donating to the very best charity, you’re not helping others as much as possible. Furthermore, if you don’t spend your time in the best way possible, that is coming at a cost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We use rules of thumb to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty (which turns out to be almost every single decision we make). This is both a blessing and a curse. It’s quicker, useful when we don’t have much information we could deal with explicitly. But also by its nature requires us to make generalisations that might not turn out to be true.

<p>Assigning a probability before an event, receiving evidence, and updating the probability you assigned. This is beneficial insofar as it forces us to <a href="https://yourbrainonecon.wordpress.com/tag/probabilistic-thinking/">think probabilistically</a>. Moreover, it allows us to account for competing evidence and promotes a nuanced view, thus avoiding a simplistic black and white application of ‘good and bad’ outcomes.</p>

<p>The probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of each outcome. For example, a 50% chance of winning $100 is worth $50 to you, and you should be willing to invest up to $50 for a chance to win (but no more). Applied example: If you have two mutually exclusive ways of helping people, should you take the 10% chance of helping 1 billion people, or the 90% chance at helping 1 million (an equal amount as the billion, and holding all else equal)? Without using expected value, this is a nearly impossible question to evaluate.</p>

<p>We’d prefer to have $100 today than tomorrow, or in a year’s time. In a real sense, this implies that money today is worth more than money in the future.

In this situation, there are two players choosing between cooperating and not cooperating. You both do well if you both cooperate. But if you don’t cooperate while the other player tries to cooperate, you do even better. If both of you don’t cooperate then neither of you do well. But if you’re the chump who tries to cooperate while the other player doesn’t, you get screwed worst of all. Examples of this include countries individually benefitting economically from not limiting their carbon emissions, to everyone’s detriment; athletes using performance enhancing drugs to be more individually competitive, when all athletes would be worse off if everyone did it; everyone in society benefits from paying taxes to get roads, but each citizen would rather have the road and not pay taxes herself; etc..</p>

On the other hand if your friend Grace can convert her free time into $50 an hour at work, then for her driving the extra hour is a poor use of time. What’s more, if both Grace and yourself are volunteering alongside each other in a soup kitchen when you’d be happy to work there for $10 an hour, Grace should consider working instead, donating the money she earns, and employing 5 people like you to run the kitchen per hour she is at work.</p>
