      <description>These questions are designed to see how you would perform with real world programming challenges. If you were asked by your manager to design some system, what would you do?
Tips:  Communicate: A key goal of system design questions is to evaluate your ability to communicate. Stay engaged with the interviewer. Ask them questions. Be open about the issues of your system. Go broad first Use the whiteboard: Using a whiteboard helps your interviewer follow your proposed design.</description>

      <description>Backtracking [1] Backtracking is a technique used to build up to a solution to a problem incrementally. These &amp;ldquo;partial solutions&amp;rdquo; can be phrased in terms of a sequence of decisions. Once it is determined that a &amp;ldquo;partial solution&amp;rdquo; is not viable (i.e. no subsequent decision can convert it into a solution) then the backtracking algorithm retraces its step to the last viable &amp;ldquo;partial solution&amp;rdquo; and tries again.
Visualizing the decisions as a tree, backtracking has many of the same properties of depth-first search.</description>
